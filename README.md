Title: AvatarCraft - Custom 2D Avatar Creator

AvatarCraft is a web application designed to empower users to express themselves creatively by customizing unique 2D avatars. With an intuitive user interface and a wide range of customization options, AvatarCraft allows users to design avatars that reflect their personalities and preferences. From choosing facial features to selecting outfits and accessories, the possibilities are endless.

The app also features an admin section where the creator can manage avatar properties, allowing for continuous expansion and customization options. Users can download their creations as images, share them with friends, and even add text bubbles and backgrounds to personalize their avatars further.

With future updates, AvatarCraft will introduce user accounts for saving and sharing avatars, as well as premium features for users who wish to access exclusive customization options. Additionally, the app will integrate donation options for users who want to support the creator's work and unlock special features.
